Questions:
    - What does it log, log transaction (filewrite at file.c).
    - difference between dinode to inode.
    - Should we add padding to the inode (not only the dinode)? And, did we pad correctly?
    - What is the difference between 'ref' and 'nlink' in 'struct inode'?
    - In mkfs.c - do we need to change anything else, other than the size (FSSIZE)?
    - It looks like 'balloc' doesn't respect the file-system order - since it just looks for a free block.. What about the purpose of that block?


Todo:
    - Section 1:
        - Write 'sanity-test' as written in the assignment.
    
    - Section 2:
        - ...


Notes:
    - Changes we made for section 1 of the assignment (make sure this is enough, and implemented well):
        - fs.h: Added another Indirect (doubly) entry in addresses of the dinode struct, and padding.
        - file.h: Added another indirect (double) entry in addresses, with no padding.
        - fs.c: Added functionality of finding (and\or allocating) the nth block of a file in the disk for the doubly-indirect block.
        - param.h: Changed FSSIZE to 2^17=131072 instead of 1000 (blocks).
        - Added the system call "sanity_check" - although don't need to - this can be deleted.
        - Added the user program "sanity", which performs the sanity check wanted in the assignment.
    
    - Changes we made for section 2 of the assignment:
        - Added an enumeration for SYMLINK file type in stat.h.
        - Added the system calls 'symlink' and 'readlink' as described in the assingment.
